# Academic-shortcuts-for-iOS
Below I  am collecting a range of shortcuts for ios of use to academics. Feel free to contribute to new shortcuts or modifications of existing ones, report issues etc.

# The list
## ArXiv
* [ArXiv name search](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/be21b27bdf9d42e89ee1da4a96eb6bad) Reads the daily updates in the hep-th, hep-ph and math-ph categories, and searchs them for a list of supplied names. If a given name is found it will appear in a notification. Useful to keep track if your favourite set of authors have published.
* [ArXiv to bibTeX](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/033b9b87c8ed4d7e8c4b29e1704fca04) User inputs arXiv id, and shortcut adds reference to arXiv version of article to a pre-specified bibtex file. It also downloads the pdf and saves it in a pre-specified folder, and saves that file to book. 
## LaTeX
* [Time-tag](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c5fb3345c2ca489084948f6c0161b511) Finds unix time in minutes, and then converts to base 32 for a short tag. Useful for e.g. labels in latex (if you lack imgination).
* [tikz-cd diagrams](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/705a50300afb45308de2379a8562121f)
