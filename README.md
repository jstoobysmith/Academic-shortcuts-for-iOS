# Academic-shortcuts-for-iOS
Below I  am collecting a range of shortcuts for ios of use to academics. Feel free to contribute to new shortcuts or modifications of existing ones, report issues etc.

# The list
* [ArXiv name search](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ba2cf7bd48c840f9965c644d863711c4) Searches the arXiv recent posts in the hep-th,hep-ph,math-ph for a list of supplied names. Recomended to set this running as an automation. 
* [Time-tag](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c5fb3345c2ca489084948f6c0161b511) Useful of labels in latex if you lack imagination. Finds unix time in minutes, and then converts to base 32 for a short tag.
